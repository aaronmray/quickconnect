# Quick Connect mod for Valheim

Adds a quick connect window with a configurable list of servers, no more dealing with steam's buggy favorites widow and entering passwords (twice).  
  
**Installation**
1.  [Install BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) following the instructions at the link.
      * If you have Valheim Plus, you can skip that step as it already includes it with the download.
3.  Extract the zip file into your BepInEx folder
4.  Edit quick_connect_servers.cfg in BepInEx/config folder to add your servers
5.  Run the game and press connect button on title screen

Config file has a list of servers in the following format:
  

```
name:addr:port[:password]
```

**addr** can be ether IP or a fully qualified domain name.

**password** is optional, you can skip it if your server doesn't need a password or if you don't want to write it down.
  
**Example config:**

```
Awesome Server:127.0.0.1:2456:smellysocks
```
